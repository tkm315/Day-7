PostgreSQL
-----------

open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)

 from simple web apps to large-scale data warehousing and analytics solutions can use Postgresql

 learn from here : https://neon.tech/postgresql/tutorial

install it . connect via psql and pgadmin 4

restore a data into "dvdrental" database via psql and pgadmin

learned this commans =     SELECT
    Column Aliases
    ORDER BY
    SELECT DISTINCT

    WHERE can combined with something that in WHERE.csv(the file in top of this page)

AND : Use the AND operator to combine multiple boolean expressions.

OR : Use the OR operator to combine multiple boolean expressions.

LIMIT , OFFSET : Use the PostgreSQL LIMIT OFFSET clause to retrieve a subset of rows returned by a query.

FETCH vs LIMIT wich one is better ? If you are working on PostgreSQL and are not concerned about SQL standard compatibility, 
you can use whichever is more convenient. 
However, if your projects may also interact with other databases,
fetch is a better choice due to its standardization.
